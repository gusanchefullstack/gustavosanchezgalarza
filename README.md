I am an electronics and telecommunications engineer. I have decided to take advantage of part of my time in this imposed quarantine to continue learning in an area that fascinates me and surprises me with its rapid innovation: web development.
Initially focused on learning the essential components to be a frontend developer but I will gradually learn the basics to develop an application on the backend. The guides that I have used to create my own path are https://platzi.com/web/, https://roadmap.sh/frontend and https://frontendmasters.com/guides/learning-roadmap/.

Being a webdev has been a desired route for a while and what better time than now to do it ...

I hope to start blogging soon about some of the topics that most attract my attention along this path, a recommendation from many developers to practice Public Learning.

Thanks for reading me! 👍

Gustavo
