I am an electronics and telecommunications engineer, with more than 20 years of experience. I have worked in different areas within technology companies including network design and architecture, technical pre-sales of telecommunications solutions and in the last 12 years I have been a professional in software and SaaS sales. I have decided to take advantage of part of my time in this imposed quarantine to continue learning in an area that fascinates me and surprises me with its rapid innovation: web development.
Initially focused on learning the essential components to be a frontend developer but I will gradually learn the basics to develop an application on the backend. The guides that I have used to create my own path are https://platzi.com/arquitecto/, https://roadmap.sh/frontend and https://frontendmasters.com/.

Being a dev has been a desired route for a while and what better time than now to do it ...

I hope to start blogging soon about some of the topics that most attract my attention along this path, a recommendation from many developers to practice Public Learning.

Thanks for reading me! 👍

Gustavo
